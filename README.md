# smart-streetlight-system
IOT based smart streetlight system project based on arduino uno

In our project, we use Arduino Uno as the controller and use Infra-Red sensors to detect the presence of objects or vehicles within the sensor radius. If the vehicle is present in its vicinity, the LED(street light) will light up otherwise it will be in OFF state.
