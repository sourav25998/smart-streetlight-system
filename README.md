# smart-streetlight-system
IOT based smart streetlight system project based on arduino uno

In our project, we use Arduino Uno as the controller and use Infra-Red sensors to detect the presence of objects or vehicles within the sensor radius. If the vehicle is present in its vicinity, the LED(street light) will light up otherwise it will be in OFF state.

Hardware consist following equipment-
Arduino Uno,
IR Sensors,
10k resistors,
LEDs,
Jump Wires,
Bread Board.

Arduino Uno is used as a controller here to control the LEDs, LDRs, and IR sensors. Four IR sensors are added here, which are connected to the power supply and output to arduino uno. LEDs are connected to the output of the  IR sensor.LDR is being used here to detect the darkness .and light power.
